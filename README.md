# Voucher Processing Program

## Overview

This repository contains a program designed to process a demo voucher file containing airtime vouchers. The program will generate an output text file formatted for printing via a dot matrix voucher printer.

## Validation

The program performs basic file validation by checking that the number of actual vouchers in the body matches the summary values in the header. If validation fails, the program will exit with an appropriate error message.

## Test Cases

A set of test cases has been developed to ensure comprehensive coverage of the program's functionality.
